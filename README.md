This project is an **Object-Oriented Python application** for managing and generating student report cards. It allows users to:  
- Define subjects with maximum marks.  
- Create student report cards with multiple subjects.  
- Enter marks for each subject.  
- Calculate the total, percentage, and grade.  
- Generate a detailed report card for each student.  

## 🚀 Features
